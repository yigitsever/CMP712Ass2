* Concatenated the training files together since we are only dealing with
categories during training, test files should still be sepearate though
* Spent 2 hours on fixing the encoding of the files
I think i will just convert all to utf8 then search & replace

Well ı and İ maps to the same character how cool is that
(enconv and enca was useless, uchardet into iconv kind of saved the day)

managed to end up with 5 files which are 5 categories appended together
